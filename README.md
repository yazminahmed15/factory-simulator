⚙️ Factory Conveyor Game
A 2D game built with Processing, where players must manage footballs on a moving conveyor belt while keeping the score under 10.

📖 Overview
The Factory Conveyor Game is a simple yet engaging 2D simulation game where players must drag different footballs into a box that moves along a conveyor belt from right to left. The goal is to prevent the score from exceeding 10 while the box is still moving. If the score goes beyond 10, the game ends.

This project was developed using the Processing framework, which is widely used for visual arts and game development in Java.

🚀 Features
✅ Drag different footballs into a moving box 🏀
✅ Conveyor belt animation for realistic movement 🔄
✅ Score management system to track performance 🎯
✅ Game over condition when the score exceeds 10 ❌
✅ Simple and intuitive gameplay mechanics 🎮

🛠️ Technologies Used
Processing (Java-based framework) – Graphics and game logic
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Structure and game mechanics
Custom physics & animations – Smooth object dragging and movement

📌 How to Run the Game
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/factory-conveyor-game.git
cd factory-conveyor-game
2️⃣ Open in Processing
Open the Processing IDE (Download from processing.org).
Open the FactoryGame.pde file.
Click the Run ▶️ button to start the game.
🎮 How to Play
Footballs will appear on the right side of the conveyor belt.
Drag and drop them into the moving box before they reach the left edge.
Keep the score under 10 to continue playing.
If the score exceeds 10, the game ends.


🛠️ Future Improvements
🔹 Add sound effects for dragging and dropping footballs 🎵
🔹 Implement different types of footballs with unique effects ⚽🏈🏀
🔹 Improve collision detection and physics for smoother interaction 🔄
🔹 Add difficulty levels with faster conveyor belt movement ⏩
